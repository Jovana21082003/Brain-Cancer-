# Brain-Cancer
The main goal of this project was to detect brain tumours using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This model classifies brain images into two categories 'Healthy' and 'Brain Tumor'. The original dataset was split into training and validation sets. The model was trained on the training set and its performance was evaluated using the validation set.
After training for 5 epochs, the model achieved a training accuracy of 98.32% with a training loss of 0.0585. This indicates that the model is learning the features of the training dataset effectively and minimizing the error over time.
Once training was complete, the model was evaluated on the validation set. The final validation accuracy reached 95.87%, while the validation loss dropped to 0.0197. These results suggest that the model is generalizing well to unseen data without overfitting.
